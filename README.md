# AAK-Tasks
### To run this project, you need to install the following packages:
docker build -t aak-tasks .
docker run -p 8000:8000 aak-tasks

I am also attaching sqlite database file for the project.
You can use my database file to run the project. you will get the users and tasks data.
### I created two users:
 FIrst user
    usernamee: musman
    password: usman
 Second user
    username: usman

### How you can test these api endpoints:
You can use postman to test the api. I have attached the postman collection file in root folder even we created some data in the database for every entity

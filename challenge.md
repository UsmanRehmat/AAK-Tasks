# AAK-Tasks
To run this project, you need to install the following packages:
docker build -t aak-tasks .
docker run -p 8000:8000 aak-tasks

I am also attaching sqlite database file for the project.
You can use my database file to run the project. you will get the users and tasks data.
I created two users:
FIrst user
    usernamee: musman
    password: usman
Second user
    username: usman
